# Snoring-detection
Snoring is one of the most common sleeping problems. It causes sleep deprivation to the snorers as well as the people around them. It can cause significant psychological and social damage in addition to the physiological damage to the sufferers. Multiple studies reveal a positive correlation between loud snoring and risk of heart attack and stroke. 

There have been many attempts to identify snoring instances through microphones but not many to detect it using body vibrations (ballistocardiography). Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to write code to do the same. In the data folder you can find 5 files of 4 minutes of vibration data each with some snoring instances in them.
